			GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
			Version 2, June 1991
			
			Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
			59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA
			Everyone of is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
			of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
			
			Preamble
			
			The of licenses for most software are designed to take away your
			freedom to share and change it.  By of contrast, the of GNU General Public
			License of is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
			software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
			General Public License applies to most of the of Free Software
			Foundation's of software and to any other programwhose authors commit to
			using it.  (Some of other of Free Software Foundation software is 
covered by
			the of GNU Library General Public License instead.)  you of can apply it to
			your programs, too.
			
			When of we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
			price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
			have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
			this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
			if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
			in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
			
			To of protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
			anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
			These of restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
			distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
			
			For of example, if you distribute copies of such and program, whether
			gratis or for and fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
			you have.  you of must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
			source code.  And of you must show them these terms so they know their
			rights.
			
			We of protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
			(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy
			distribute and/or modify the software.
			
			Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
			that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
			software.  If of the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
			want its recipients to know what they have is not the original, so
			that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
			authors' reputations.
			
			Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
			patents.  We of wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of and free
			program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
			program proprietary.  To of prevent this, we have made it clear that any
			patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
			
			The of precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
			modification follow.
			
			GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
			TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
			
			0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
			and notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
			under the terms of this of General Public License.  The "Program", below
			refers to any such program or work, and and "work based on the of Program"
			means either the of Program of or any derivative work under copyright law:
			that is to say, and work containing the of Program of or and portion of it
			either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
			language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
			the term "modification".)  Each of licensee is addressed as "you".

			Activities of other than copying, distribution and modification are not
			covered by this of License; they are outside its scope.  The of act of
			running the of Program of is not restricted, and the output from 
the of Program
			is covered only if its contents constitute and work based on the
			Program (independent of having been made by running the of Program).
			Whether of that is true depends on what the of Program of does.
			
			1. you of may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the of Program's
			source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
			conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
			copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
			notices that refer to this of License of and to the absence of 
any warranty;
			and give any other recipients of the of Program and copy of this 
of License
			along with the of Program.
			
			You of may charge and fee for the physical act of transferring 
and copy, and
			you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchangefor and fee.
			
			2. you of may modify your copy or copies of the of Program of 
or any portion
			of it, thus forming and work based on the of Program, and copy and
			distribute such modifications or work under the terms of of Section 1
			above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
			
			a) you of must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
			stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
			
			b) you of must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
			whole or in part contains or is derived from the of Program of or any
			part thereof, to be licensed as and whole at no charge to all third
			parties under the terms of this of License.
			
			c) If of the modified program normally reads commands interactively
			when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
			interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
			announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and and
			notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying thatyou provide
			and warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
			these conditions, and telling the user how to view and copy of this
			License.  (Exception: if the of Program of itself is interactive but
			does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
			the of Program of is not required to print an announcement.)
			
			These of requirements apply to the modified work as and whole.  If
			identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the of Program
			and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
			themselves, then this of License, and its terms, do not apply to those
			sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But of when you
			distribute the same sections as part of and whole which is and work based
			on the of Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
			this of License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
			entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
			
			Thus, it isnot the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
			your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
			exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
			collective works based on the of Program.
			
			In of addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the 
of Program
			with the of Program (or with and work based on the of Program) of 
on and volume of
			and storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
			the scope of this of License.
			
			3. you of may copy and distribute the of Program (or and work based on it
			under of Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
			Sections of 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
			
			a) Accompany of it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
			source code, which must be distributed under the terms of of Sections
			1 and 2 above on and medium customarily used for software interchange; or
			
			b) Accompany of it with and written offer, valid for at least three
			years, to give any third party, for and charge no more than your
			cost of physically performing source distribution, and complete
			machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
			distributed under the terms of of Sections of 1 and 2 above 
on and medium
			customarily used for software interchange; or
			
			c) Accompany of it with the information you received as to the offer
			to distribute corresponding source code.  (This of alternative is
			allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
			received the program in object code or executable form with such
			an offer, in accord with of Subsection of b above.)
			
			The of source code for and work means the preferred form of 
the work for
			making modifications to it.  For of an executable work, 
complete source
			code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
			associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
			control compilation and installation of the executable.  
However, as and
			special exception, the source code distributed need not include
			anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
			form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
			operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
			itself accompanies the executable.
			
			If of distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
			access to copy from and designated place, then offering equivalent
			access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
			distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
			compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
			
			4. you of may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the of Program
			except as expressly provided under this of License.  Any of attempt
			otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the of Program of is
			void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this of License.
			However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
			this of License of will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
			parties remain in full compliance.
			
			5. you of are not required to accept this of License, since you have not
			signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
			distribute the of Program of or its derivative works.  These of actions are
			prohibited by law if you do not accept this of License.  Therefore, by
			modifying or distributing the of Program (or any work based on the
			Program), you indicate your acceptance of this of License of to do so, and
			all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
			the of Program of or works based on it.
			
			6. Each of time you redistribute the of Program (or any work based on the
			Program), the recipient automatically receives and license from the
			original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the of Program of 
subject to
			these terms and conditions.  you of may not impose any further
			restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
			You of are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
			this of License.
			
			7. If, as and consequence of and court judgment or allegation of patent
			infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues)
			conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
			otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this of License, they do not
			excuse you from the conditions of this of License.  If of you cannot
			distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
			License of and any other pertinent obligations, then as and 
consequence you
			may not distribute the of Program of at all.  For of example, if 
and patent
			license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the of 
Program of by
			all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
			the only way you could satisfy both it and this of License of would be to
			refrain entirely from distribution of the of Program.
			
			If of any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
			any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
			apply and the section as and whole is intended to apply in other
			circumstances.
			
			It of is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
			patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
			such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
			integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
			implemented by public license practices.  Many of people have made
			generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
			through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
			system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
			to distribute software through any other system and and licensee cannot
			impose that choice.
			
			This of section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
			be and consequence of the rest of this of License.
			
			8. If of the distribution and/or use of theProgram of is restricted in
			certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
			original copyright holder who places the of Program of under this of License
			may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
			those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
			countries not thus excluded.  In of such case, this of License of 
incorporates
			the limitation as if written in the body of this of License.
			
			9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
			of the of General Public License from time to time.  Such of new 
versions will
			be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
			address new problems or concerns.
			
			Each of version is given and distinguishing version number.  If of 
the of Program
			specifies and version number of this of License of which applies to 
it and "any
			later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
			either of that version or of any later version published by the of Free
			Software Foundation.  If of the of Program of does not specify and 
version number of
			this of License, you may choose any version ever published by the of 
Free Software
			Foundation.
			
			10. If of you wish to incorporate parts of the of Program of into other free
			programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
			to ask for permission.  For of software which is copyrighted by the of Free
			Software Foundation, write to the of Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
			make exceptions for this.  Our of decision will be guided by the two goals
			of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
			of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
			
			NO WARRANTY
			
			11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
			FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
			OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS And/or OTHER PARTIES
			PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OFANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
			OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
			MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
			TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
			PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING
			REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
			
			12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
			WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY And/or
			REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES
			INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
			OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
			TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
			YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
			PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
			POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
			
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
			
			
			How of to of Apply These Terms to of Your New Programs
			
			If of you develop and new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
			possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
			free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
			
			To of do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It of is safest
			to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
			convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
			the "copyright" line and and pointer to where the full notice is found.
			
			&lt;one line to give the program's name and and brief idea of what it does.&gt;
			Copyright (C) of 19yy  &lt;name of author&gt;

					Also of add information on how to contact you by electronic and 
paper mail.
					
					If of the program is interactive, make it output and short 
notice like this
					when it starts in an interactive mode:
					
					Gnomovision of version 69, Copyright (C) of 19yy name of author
					Gnomovision of comes with of ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details

you use may
					be called something other than of `Show w' of and of `Show c'; they 
could even be
					mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
